## Coding Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use camelCase for all file names. Avoid spaces and special characters. **Example:**
  `reverseString.js` is allowed but `ReverseString.js`, `reverse-string.js`, `reverse_string.js` are not.
- **Comments**: Include a detailed description of the challenge in the comments at the top of the file.
- **Code Style**: Follow consistent coding practices. Ensure your code is well-organized and easy to read.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Each pull request should only change one challenge file. To ease review, please open separate pull requests for
  separate challenges.
- Ensure all new JavaScript files are placed inside the correct category directory.
- Include a URL in the comments of the challenge file that points to Wikipedia or another similar explanation if
  applicable.
